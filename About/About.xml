Ever wanted to explode like a pinata to celebrate settling on a new tile, after fleeing the burning ruins of your old life? Me neither. This tiny mod simply makes it so that any time your caravan would drop everything when entering a new tile, all pawns and animals will hold on to their inventory instead.

This mod is safe to add or remove at any time.
